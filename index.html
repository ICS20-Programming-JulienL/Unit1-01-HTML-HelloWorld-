<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<p>My name is Julien Lamoureux and I am a Grade 10 student at Immaculata High School.</p>
<h2> My favorite pastime :</h2>
<p>  My favorite pastime is playing my guitar for a variety of reasons. First, I enjoy creating new songs and learning different genres of music on my instrument. Second, the guitar is a very important instrument in my family, as my father has played for over 40 years, and my grandfather played in a band. Lastly, the guitar is an instrument with a soothing sound that forms a calming ambiance when I need it the most. </p>
<h2> My least favorite subject :</h2>
  <p>  My least favorite subject is Gym for the following reasons. First, I find that most gym classes are more team-sport-based instead of being based on individual fitness. In addition, sport-based activities do not interest me, and I would prefer to learn about how to maintain a healthy, active life in other ways.  </p>
